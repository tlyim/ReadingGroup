# Chen et al (2015) vs. D'Souza et al's (2010){x.smaller}

* Developed a **disaggregation quality** measure (**DQ**) by counting nonmissing data items in company annual reports as reported by Compustat 
  - {.fragment} As opposed to Dâ€™Sofia et al's (2010) **disclosure ratio** measure concerning how comprehensive the disclosure in **earnings announcements** is compared to that in the SEC filings (based on line items reported in Compustat **Preliminary History** and **Unrestated Quarterly** databases).  



~Begin Vertical {x.remarks}

# Recognition and Disclosure  

* The DQ measure covers items in the **footnotes**, besides those in the financial statements.
  - {.fragment} Hence, make no distinction between recognition (FS items) and disclosure (fn items)
  - {.fragment} (?) Does this mean a research opportunity to devise measures for **FS-DQ** and **fn-DQ**?



# "All" Compustat firms

* Applicable to the universe of Compustat firms (excluding **financial** and **utility** firms due to different _Compustat Balancing Models_ and also **foreign** firms) 
  - {.fragment} not just some subset of firms (eg, large) or only part of the annual report (eg, narrative reporting in MD&A)
  - {.fragment} (?) Research opportunity to devise measures for **financial firms **(eg, **banks**)?



# Suggestion for future research

* Chen et al (2015): Relation between DQ measure and **audit quality**, and **other aspects of financial reporting quality**
  - {.fragment} (?) more disaggregation means the need to check each disaggregated disclosure
  - {.fragment} (?) Higher **audit fees** (because more work to do and higher litigation cost as more items subject to audit failure) 

~End Vertical



# Random thought {.smaller}

* (?) In the investment decision to **choose a stock from two** competing stocks from **different industries** (thus, with different disclosure practices in line with the two industries), 
  - {.fragment} How to factor in the difference in their disclosure qualities? (eg, how to **trade off disclosure quality and stock price**?)

* {.fragment} (?) Weight the importance of a missing item in an industry by its frequency in appearing in financial reports in that industry? (ie, **penalize more if **the missing item is **rarely missing in that industry**).
  - {.fragment} Is this different/better than simply **adjusting for industry FEs uniformly**?
